Using the [RFP-Trap Agarose Kit](https://www.ptglab.com/products/RFP-Trap-Agarose-rta.htm) on _Nemtostella vectensis_ embryos injected with a plasmid containing the fluorescent protein mCherry bound to the acidic coral protein CARP1.

For this extraction I used the manufacturer [protocol](https://www.ptglab.com/products/pictures/pdf/rta_Manual_RFP-Trap_Agarose.pdf) with some adjustments.

**Embryo cell lysis**
1. Use a [tissue homogenizer](https://www.btlabsystems.com/handheld_homogenizer_battery_operated?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwjMiiBhA4EiwAZe6jQ5n2vjFwlabrGbrb7Zmra4MpDcNb4Us-XvloVxch9-EBl7SbFmM2thoC6PcQAvD_BwE) to lyse the embryos inside a 2 mL cryo tube containing 200 µL Lysis buffer together with a protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 mM PMSF.
2. Place the tube on ice for 30 minutes, pipetting the suspension every 10 min.
3. Centrifuce the lysate at 17000g for 10 minutes at +4°C. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and add 300 µL Dilution buffer together with a protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 mM PMSF.

**Bead equilibration**
1. Resuspend the beads by gently pipetting up and down. 
2. Transfer 25 µL of bead slurry into a new 1.5 mL tube.
3. Add 500 µL ice-cold Dilution buffer.
4. Sediment the beads by centrifugation at 2500x g for 5 min at +4°C. Discard the supernatant.

**Protien binding**
1. Add diluted lysate to the equilibrated beads.
2. Rotate end-over-end for 1 hour at +4°C.

**Washing**
1. Sediment the beads by centrifugation at 3000x g for 5 min at +4°C.
2. Save the supernatant for further analysis (flow-through/non-bound fraction).
3. Discard remaining supernatant.
4. Resuspend beads in 500 µL Wash buffer.
5. Sediment the beads by centrifugation at 3000x g for 5 min at +4°C. Discard remaining supernatant.
6. Repeat this step at least twice.
7. During the last washing step, transfer the beads to a new tube.

**Elution with 2x SDS-sample buffer (Laemmi)**
1. Remove the remaining supernatant.
2. Resuspend beads in 80 µL [2x SDS-sample buffer](https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/sku/1610737edu-2x-laemmli-sample-buffer?ID=1610737EDU)(not provided by the kit).
3. Boil beads for 5 min at +95°C to dissociate protein complexes from the beads.
4. Sediment the beads by centrifugation at 3000x g for 2 min at +4°C.
5. Analyze the supernatant in SDS-PAGE. See the protcol [here](https://fscucchia.github.io/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Martindale_Lab/2023-05-03-Protein-gel-electroph/).
