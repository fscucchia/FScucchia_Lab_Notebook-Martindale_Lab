Using the [RFP-Trap Agarose Kit](https://www.ptglab.com/products/RFP-Trap-Agarose-rta.htm) on _Nemtostella vectensis_ embryos injected with a plasmid containing the fluorescent protein mCherry bound to the acidic coral protein CARP1.

For this extraction I used the manufacturer [protocol](https://www.ptglab.com/products/pictures/pdf/rta_Manual_RFP-Trap_Agarose.pdf) with some adjustments.
