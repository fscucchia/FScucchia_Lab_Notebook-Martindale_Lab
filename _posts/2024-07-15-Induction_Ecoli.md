The pBAD plasmids are pBR322-derived expression vectors designed for regulated, secreted recombinant protein expression and purification in E. coli. 

**Steps**
1. For each transformant or control, inoculate 2 mL of SOB or LB containing 50 µg/mL ampicillin with a single recombinant E. coli colony. Note: If you are using LMG194 as a host, use RM medium containing glucose and 50-100 µg/mL ampicillin at all steps. 
2. Grow overnight at 37°C with shaking (225–250 rpm) to OD 600  = 1–2. 
3. The next day, label five tubes 1 through 5 and add 10 mL of medium containing 50 µg/mL ampicillin.  
4. Inoculate each tube with 0.1 mL of the overnight culture. 
5. Grow the cultures at 37°C with vigorous shaking to an OD 600  = ~0.5 (the cells should be in mid-log phase)(~5 hours).
6. While the cells are growing, prepare four 10-fold serial dilutions of 20% L-arabinose with sterile water (e.g. 2%, 0.2%, 0.02%, and 0.002%).  
7. Remove a 1 mL aliquot of cells from each tube, centrifuge at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge for 30 seconds, and aspirate the supernatant. 
8. Freeze the cell pellet at –20°C. This is the zero time point sample. 
9. Add L-arabinose to the five 10 mL cultures as follows:
|Tube|  Volume (mL)|  Stock Solution|  Final Concentration|| 
|1  |0.1 | 0.002%|  0.00002% |
|2  |0.1 | 0.02% | 0.0002% |
|3 | 0.1|  0.2%|  0.002% |
|4 | 0.1|  2% | 0.02% |
|5  |0.1|  20% | 0.2% |

10.  Grow at 20-25°C with shaking overnight.  
11.  Take 1 mL samples and treat as in Step 7 and 8.
