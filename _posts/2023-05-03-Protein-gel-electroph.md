Using the [NuPAGE Bis-Tris Mini Gel](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/NP0321BOX) for protein purification experiments on transgenic _Nemtostella vectensis_ embryos.

For this extraction I used the manufacturer [protocol](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0007891_NuPAGE_BisTris_MiniGels.pdf) with some modifications.

**Prepare samples**
Volumes are provided for a 10-μL sample size. 
| Components | Reduced sample | Non-reduced Sample |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Sample | x μL | x μL |
| NuPAGE™ LDS Sample Buffer (4X) | 2.5 μL | 2.5 μL |
| Reducing Agent (2-mercaptoethanol) | 2.5% final concentration | — |
| Deionized Water | to 6.5 µL | to 7.5 µL |
| Total Volume | 10 µL | 10 µL |

Heat samples at 70˚C for 10 minutes.

**Prepare buffers**
Add 50 mL of 20X NuPAGE MES SDS Running Buffer to 950 mL of deionized water to prepare 1X SDS Running Buffer.

**Prepare gel**
1. Remove the comb, and rinse the gel wells three times using 1X Running Buffer.
2. Remove the white tape near the bottom of the gel cassettes.
3. Place the gels in the mini gel tank

**Load buffers**
For the [XCell SureLock™ Mini-Cell](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-gel-electrophoresis/protein-gel-electrophoresis-chamber-systems/xcell-surelock-mini-vertical-electrophoresis-system.html), add 600 mL of 1X running buffer to the lower chamber, and 200 mL to the upper chamber.

**Load samples and molecular marker**
1. Load 10 µL of your samples in the appropriate wells.
2. Load your protein ladder in the appropriate well.

**Run the gel**
Run for 25 minutes at 200 V constant.

**Gel staining**
I used the [AcquaStain Protein Gel Stain](https://www.bulldog-bio.com/product/acquastain-protein-gel-stain/?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwjMiiBhA4EiwAZe6jQ6mHKK4COmXJOdLbjlv1iLPCYG7dPjkvxbq2her8nINJ9SCjrXUKHRoCZsQQAvD_BwE).
1. Add enough stain to cover gel completely. 
2. Incubate overnight at 4°C.
3. Wash the gel in deionized water for at least 20 min.
