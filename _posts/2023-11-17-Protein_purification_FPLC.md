This protocol was designed to isolate coral CARP4, sea urchin SM30 and mouse ameloblastin proteins from transgenic _Nematostella vectensis_ embryos. 

I'm using here the [ÄKTA go - FPLC system](https://www.bionity.com/en/products/1128708/aekta-go-fplc-made-compact.html) with 1mL HisTrap HP columns.


**Buffers preparation**

_All buffers must pass through 0.45µm filter before use_

•	Buffer A: 50mM Tris-HCl, 0.5M NaCl, 10mM Imidazole pH 7.4
•	Buffer B: Buffer A + 250mM Imidazole
•	0.5M NaOH
•	20% EtOH

**Sample preparation**
1. Add 0.6 mL of buffer A + 0.2mg/mL lysozyme + 0.6 mL [protease-inhibitor](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/roche/coro) to a 2mL tube containing at least 3000 transgenic embryos.
2. Homogenize for <1 minute using an electrical homogenizer.
3. Leave on ice for 20 minutes.
4. Filter the sample using a 0.45µm filter.

**Sample application**

_Wash all tubes and pumps with DDW before every stage_
1. Equilibrate column for 3 CV with Buffer A at 0.5mL/min. 
2. Load 400uL of sample at 1mL/min using a syringe (sample loop of 500uL). 
3. Wash column for 10 CV with 100% Buffer A at 1mL/min.
4. Gradient Elution: Buffers A & B, flow rate 1mL/min, collect 1mL fractions. 
5. Wash column for 2 CV with 100%B at 1mL/min.
6. Wash column for 3 CV with DI at 3mL/min.

**Column wash and storage**

•	Flow rate 1mL/min
1. Wash column for 3 CV with DI.
2. Wash column for 3 CV with 0.5M NaOH.
3. Wash column for 3 CV with 20% EtOH.

Run a [gel](https://fscucchia.github.io/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Martindale_Lab/2023-06-03-Protein-gel-electroph/) to look at the purified protein sample.
