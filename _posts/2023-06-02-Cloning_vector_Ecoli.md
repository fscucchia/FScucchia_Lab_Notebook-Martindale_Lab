Transgenic constructs were designed using the software programs Serial Cloner and [Geneious Prime 2021.2.2](https://www.geneious.com). Inserts were G-blocked using the [Twist Bioscience clanal genes tool](https://www.twistbioscience.com/products/genes?tab=clonal).

**Transformation**
1. Dissolve the construct in nuclease-free water to obtain a concentration of ~70-80 ng/uL.
2.
