Transgenic constructs were designed using the software programs Serial Cloner and [Geneious Prime 2021.2.2](https://www.geneious.com). Inserts were G-blocked using the [Twist Bioscience clanal genes tool](https://www.twistbioscience.com/products/genes?tab=clonal).

**Transformation**
1. Dissolve the construct in nuclease-free water to obtain a concentration of ~70-80ng/uL.
2. Add maximum 50ng of the construct into a frozen aliquot of E. coli (50uL in a 0.5mL tube) and leave it on ice for 30 minutes.
3. In the meantime, take out from the 4°C the yeast base and leave it on the bench. Take also out two agar plates and warm them in the incubator at 37°C. 
4. After the 30 minutes add 70uL of yeast base to each plate, then add 10uL to one warmed plate and 15 uL to the other warmed plate of the construct+E.coli mixture. We prepare one plate with a lower volume than the other to prevent having both plates with too many colonies right next to each other, which would make it hard to pick only one distinc colony for PCR.
Use a swab or other tool of choice to distribute the base+E.coli on the agar.
5. Incubate the plates at 37°C overnight.

**Colony screening**
1. The morning after take out the plates from the incubator. Take out a new agar plate from the 4°C and warm it in the incubator at 37°C.
