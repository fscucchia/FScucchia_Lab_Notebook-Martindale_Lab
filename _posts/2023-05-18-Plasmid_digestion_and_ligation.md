_This protocol was created by the Martindale lab._

Transgenic constructs were preprared using the protocol [here](https://fscucchia.github.io/FScucchia_Lab_Notebook-Martindale_Lab/2023-06-02-Cloning_vector_Ecoli/). These constructs can be digested with specific restriction enzymes (depending on which enzymes were used to desogn the construct) and ligated into a vector for injections.

**_Available soon_**
